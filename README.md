# Resource packs
Allows you to create your own custom interface styles by not being only restricted to 2005/2006/2010 ones.

## How to use it:
#### **New method:**
1. Add the plugin from the runelite [plugin-hub](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Information-about-the-Plugin-Hub)
2. Look for this icon in the side panel: ![image](https://i.imgur.com/gpg7VJK.png)
3. To install one of the packs, click the green **Install** button  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5113962/85605474-dbd98900-b65a-11ea-9f32-e16a9aca9f75.png)
4. The pack will automatically install and be applied.
5. If you want to switch between the installed packs use the selected pack dropdown menu: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5113962/85605673-0f1c1800-b65b-11ea-96aa-c7682c92cda6.png)
6. You can easily remove a pack by pressing the red Remove button.

The installed packs are automatically updated when starting the client or you can press the update button in the panel to update that pack.

#### Old method
(For people who want to have a custom made pack and not the ones from the hub)
1. Add it from the runelite [plugin-hub](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Information-about-the-Plugin-Hub)
2. Download a resource pack from down below or somewhere else
3. Extract the .zip file if you downloaded from below
4. Set the path to where your resource pack is stored in (without the trailing /)  
ex. C:\Users\user\Downloads\resource-packs-pack-osrs-dark (Windows) where user is your Windows username  
![image](https://i.imgur.com/JRuVXFQ.png)  
/Users/user/Downloads/resource-packs-pack-osrs-dark (Mac) - where user is your Mac username  
[How to find your file path on Mac](https://www.maketecheasier.com/reveal-path-file-mac/)  
(It should be the path to where you can see all the folders - button, bank, chatbox, etc.)
5. Make sure your interface styles plugin gameframe is set to the DEFAULT skin (it can cause weird issues otherwise). Everything else is fine but will require a restart of the plugin should you activate any of them after you have resource pack set up.
6. After you have the path copy and paste it into where the image below has it in. Make sure there is no \ (Windows) / (Mac) at the end of it.

6. Restart the plugin and your resource pack should load in

## How to create a resource pack
1. Download one of the sample packs or resource packs
2. Edit the images while keeping the image sizes and folder structure the same  
**DO NOT PUT OR EDIT YOUR RESOURCE PACK INSIDE .runelite/resource-packs-repository OR IT WILL GET DELETED.**
3. If you want your resource pack to be published on here among the other resource packs and shown inside the resource pack hub, Contact me on discord (You can find me by the same in Runelite discord) and I will explain how.
