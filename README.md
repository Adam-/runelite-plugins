# C Engineer: Completed
##### A plugin for [RuneLite](https://runelite.net/)
C Engineer announces when you complete an achievement!

Huge thanks to [C Engineer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUNoAjAgVHEHc6jrUr4XuWQ) for providing custom recorded audio for this plugin!

### Announcement options include
- *wip* level ups
- *wip* quests *todo* change to use chat message "Congratulations, you've completed a quest: [qst name]" instead of widget loaded
- *wip* col log slot (requires game chat notification messages)
- *wip* achievement diaries
- dying "on my hcim" (plays for any account type)

### Potential future expansions
- clue scroll completion

### Known Issues
- PulseAudio on linux can just refuse to accept the audio formats used despite claiming to accept them :man_shrugging:
