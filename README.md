Emote Clue Items is a RuneLite plugin which highlights items required for emote clue steps and provides a user-friendly
item collection log with STASHUnit integration.

### Take back your bank space

Maintaining bank space can be quite cumbersome, especially when you are not sure which items should be kept for future
clue scrolls. With this plugin, throwing away items may be a bit less stressful, as this plugin aims to highlight all
emote clue items.

### New in 3.0.0: STASHUnit integration
With the release of 3.0.0, Emote Clue Items supports STASHUnits. Users are now able to select which STASHUnits are filled,
and are provided with an elaborate overview. The overview provides a plethora of details, such a collection log of items 
required to fill the STASHUnit, construction requirements and much more.

#### Filling stashes now updates the emote clue item requirement status
Listed under each emote clue item requirement, the original overview now shows which related stash units are built and/or filled. 
With this integration, next to the original inventory item tracking, requirement completion can also be performed through filling stash units.

#### Status management and updates
Whats more, STASHUnit fill statuses are stored in your Runelite's config manager for each runescape account that you have. 
By logging into your Runelite account on the client, even when you log in on another computer, your fill statuses are saved. 
STASHUnit build statuses are automatically updated when building a STASHUnit, and the results are immediately visible in the overview.

### Other plugin features
Among other interfaces, items in your bank, inventory and equipment are highlighted by their respective tier colours.
Individually, for each supported in-game interface, overlay display may be switched on or off in the plugin settings.

Whenever the user picks up an item, the item collection log of related emote clue item requirement status are updated,
cached, and displayed.

requirement name, emoteClueDifficulty and completion status filtering.
