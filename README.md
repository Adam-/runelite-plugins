- achievement diaries (per tier, not per task)
- combat achievements (per task, not per tier)
- dying "on my hcim" (plays for any account type)

and 'public' chat messages for each of the above (that only you can see)

### Planned / Work In Progress expansions
- none

### Potential future expansions

### Known Issues
- PulseAudio on linux can just refuse to accept the audio formats used despite claiming to accept them :man_shrugging:
