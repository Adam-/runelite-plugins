# Player Outline [![GitHub Workflow Status (branch)](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/neilrush/Player-Outline/Java%20CI/master?logo=github)](https://github.com/neilrush/Player-Outline/actions) [![GitHub release (latest by date including pre-releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/neilrush/Player-Outline?include_prereleases&logo=github)](https://github.com/neilrush/Player-Outline/releases) [![Plugin Installs](http://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://i.pluginhub.info/shields/installs/plugin/Player-Outline)](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/neilrush)

<p>A simple plugin that outlines the player allowing you to see the player behind objects.</p>
<p>A better alternative to a tile indicator because the default outline color makes it hardly noticeable when looking 
directly at the player model and you can see the players animations while occluded.</p>
