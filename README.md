# Tob Mistake Tracker

Tracks mistakes made by players throughout the Theatre of Blood.

---
This plugin will track mistakes for you and your teammates in the Theatre of Blood. It will also track mistakes for
other raiders while you're spectating.

By default, when detecting a mistake, all players with this plugin will receive a public message of the mistake, a
chat overhead above the player who made the mistake, and the mistake will be added to the Tob Mistake Tracker
side-panel.

Current mistakes being tracked:

* ![death](src/main/resources/com/tobmistaketracker/death.png) **Deaths** throughout the raid
