  <h1>Supplies Tracker</h1><br>
  
  
  
Tracks supplies (food, potions, teleports, ect.), Ammo (cannonballs included), runes, and weapons charges.

To turn on weapon charges box (tracker will no longer add each individual item used for a charge), look in configs.

Before using blowpipe, set which darts are being used in configs.
Blowpipe ammo used is not actual use. It is an estimate based on number of attacks.
