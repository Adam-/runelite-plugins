# C Engineer: Completed
##### A plugin for [RuneLite](https://runelite.net/)
C Engineer announces when you complete an achievement!

Huge thanks to [C Engineer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUNoAjAgVHEHc6jrUr4XuWQ) for providing custom recorded audio for this plugin!

### Announcement options include
- level ups
- quests
- collection log slot (requires game chat notification messages)
- achievement diaries
- dying "on my hcim" (plays for any account type)

and 'public' chat messages for each of the above (that only you can see)

### Potential future expansions
- clue scroll completion

### Known Issues
- PulseAudio on linux can just refuse to accept the audio formats used despite claiming to accept them :man_shrugging:
