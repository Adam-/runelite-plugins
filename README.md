Emote Clue Items is a RuneLite plugin which highlights items required for emote clue steps, and provides a user-friendly item collection log. 

### Take back your bank space
Maintaining bank space can be quite cumbersome, especially when you are not sure which items should be kept for future clue scrolls. With this plugin, throwing away items may be a bit less stressful, as this plugin aims to highlight all emote clue items.

### Example
Among other interfaces, items in your bank, inventory and equipment are highlighted by their respective tier colours. Individually, for each supported in-game interface, overlay display may be switched on or off in the plugin settings.
