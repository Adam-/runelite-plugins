# Easy Blast Furnace

Helps you train at the blast furnace more efficiently

## Features

- Supports multiple different methods
  - Gold bars
  - [Steel/Mithril/Adamant/Rune bars](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Blast_Furnace#Bar_Patterns)
  - [Gold + metal bar hybrid](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Blast_Furnace#Hybrid_Method_(Gold/Mithril+))
- Shows next item/object to click
- Shows coal bag contents
- Prompts to drink a stamina dose when required

## Requirements

- Ice gloves
- Goldsmith gauntlets (for gold bar & hybrid methods)
- Coal bag (for metal bar & hybrid methods)
- Stamina potions easily accessible in bank

The plugin will prompt you to withdraw/equip the required items before starting. It's important to also remove their placeholders and fill your bank.

It's also helpful to enable RuneLite's Blast Furnace plugin, but disable "Show conveyor belt clickbox" and "Show bar dispenser clickbox".
