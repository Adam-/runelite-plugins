# Herblore Recipes
Display tooltips on primary and secondary ingredients for Herblore.  
I was collecting herbs on my low level ironman and had no idea what I could do with them as I was collecting them.  
So I wrote this plugin to help me plan what potions I want to make as well as which herbs I want to pick up to save 
precious inventory space.

## Plugin in action
Tooltip on a finished potion, showing the ingredients.

Tooltip on an unfinished potion.

Tooltip on a secondary ingredient.

If a potion is an ingredient for another potion, it will show that.  
The tooltip will show no matter the dosage of the potion.

If an ingredient is both a primary and a secondary for different potions, it will reflect that.

Also shows up on Grimy herbs!

## Things to know
- As of now this plugin does not support barbarian mixes.
- The ingredients for some combination potions  (e.g. super combat potion) will show up as  
  secondary ingredients even though they're technically primary ingredients.
